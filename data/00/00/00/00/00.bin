  |     Summary                                                             |

  |                                                                         |
  |   Rose is half human and half dragon. One day, she wanders into a       |
  |   world called "Tree of time" with her nanny, Fairy.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   It is said that there's a powerful treasure deep under the dungeon.   |
  |   In order to return back to their village through the power of the     |
  |   treasure, they decided to face the challenges of the dungeon!         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   If Rose is defeated during the adventure, she will lose all items     |
  |   and her level will be reset. And because the dungeon transforms       |
  |   every time you challenge it, the quests will never be the same.       |
  |   Your courage and growth will be the key to clear the dungeon!         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * One choice, one victory: This game is turn-based. Both Rose and     |
  |     the enemies take turns moving. Players can think about what to do   |
  |     on their next turn. Wisdom and courage will bring you "small        |
  |     victories," and these will eventually bring you "huge victories."   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The "Fang" system: Rose can wear Fangs of monsters and gain their   |
  |     abilities. There are more than 200 kinds of monsters. You can       |
  |     seek the strongest combination and arrange your Fangs however you   |
  |     like                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The "Brave" system: Rose powers up when there are no obstacles      |
  |     around you within 8 squares. This overturns the "battling within    |
  |     the passage" theory of the Roguelike game                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * This game also has the Ranking function, Item Warehouse,            |
  |     Monster's Database, Achievement, Mini Puzzle, and Dungeon for       |
  |     Advanced Players                                                    |
